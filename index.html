      <p>Studying to be front-end developer</p>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Evzi and I am currently working on changing my career to
        become a front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a very curious person who loves to get answers to anything and
        everything I wonder about. I have a master degree in economics and
        marketing and have experience as SEO & SEM Specialist in different
        marketing agencies. What I like the most is to find solutions to
        problems and I am most happy when I can see how things get better.

      <h2>What I like to do in my free time</h2>
      <p>
        I really like to train - I do Crossfit regularly, yoga from time to time
        and I still try to persuade myself, that I can be a runner too. I've
        been to some dancing courses as well - namely swing and lindy hop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that I love to read. I've been reading books and spending
        time in a library since I was a kid. I used to read mostly horrors from
        Stephen King, but now I read fantasy majority of the times. But I don't
        say no to any interesting book of any genre.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also newly discovered liking for manga and anime. I've been a
        dedicated fan of One Piece now for over three years! My other favourite
        animes/mangas are f.eks. One Punch Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, SpyxFamily or
        Mande in Abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
        As probably everyone else, I like to travel. I am not a passionate
        traveler,but I do love to explore new places and get new experiences. I
        also enjoy just exploring my local area and go for walks and small
        hikes. I've been living in Norway for over three years now and it's my
        goal to travel around more and get to know more of the country.
